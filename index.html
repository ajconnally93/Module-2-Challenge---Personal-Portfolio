        <p>Thank you for visiting my Website! My name is Andrew Connally. I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, where I now reside with my Wife and Black Ragdoll cat. I graduated from the University of Alabama in 2016 with my Bachelor's in Economics and Marketing, with a specialization in Professional Sales. After working in Sales for approximately 2 years, I decided to self-teach Coding amidst the pandemic, as my job prospects were bare and I was having to spend all my time inside anyway. It was something I had already taken an interest in and that seemed like the perfect opportunity. I self-taught Python over the course of a few months, and then moved onto Web Development after taking an interest by being introduced to the basics of it in the Python course. I self-taught as much Web Development as I was able to, but eventually hit a wall with self-teaching, so therefore enrolling in Georgia Tech's bootcamp was the next logical step. As I continue through the semester I plan to upload finished projects, as well as improve the functionality and aesthetics of this website. The current layout and functionality is extremely barebones right now, and will be improved with practice and time.</p>
