# Module-2-Challenge---Personal-Portfolio
Personal portfolio &amp; website, built from the ground-up, to show off my projects and work

This website and repo will be periodically updated throughout the semester. The goal of this is to provide a good starting point for my portfolio so that I can update it with future projects I will be working on. You will notice that, for now, there are going to be many placeholders. These will be replaced in due time with real world examples.
