# Module-2-Challenge---Personal-Portfolio
Personal portfolio &amp; website, built from the ground-up, to show off my projects and work

This website and repo will be periodically updated throughout the semester. The goal of this is to provide a good starting point for my portfolio so that I can update it with future projects I will be working on. You will notice that, for now, there are going to be many placeholders. These will be replaced in due time with real world examples.

UPDATE right before submission, some things to take note of: There are certainly a lot of things I could have obviously done better, but this being my first ever project using CSS and HTML, I was just glad to make it work. This took me probably about 16-20 hours total and I'm cutting it close to submission time, so I can't let perfect be the enemy of "this works and the submission deadline is in only a couple hours".

Please keep in mind that I literally don't have previous projects to link to, as this is my first ever project, so I therefore used placeholder images which link to websites such as google, youtube, ESPN, Zillow, and the homepage of one of my favorite videogames.

Some easy ways I could improve upon this: better use of pseudo-classes such as hover (IE when hovering over clickable links), designing for Mobile devices first then expanding out to normal-sized monitors, using dropdown forms to select specific sections, better use of flex-box, use of the CSS Grid system (I haven't yet learned this - but it seems perfect for what I was trying to accomplish), better-done media queries (would mostly be accomplished by designing with mobile devices in mind first), much better use of calling elements in CSS, cleaner, more organized CSS code in general. If I had another week to work on this project, those are the things I would improve upon. With that being said, when it comes time to present a personal portfolio project to potential employers, I may just create an entirely new one for scratch. This was ultimately great practice as a first-ever project, but there are a LOT of things I would do differently.
